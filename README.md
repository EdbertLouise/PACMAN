# PACMAN
A PACMAN game made using C and ALLEGRO programming language. My 1st semester final project.

Steps to run the game:
1) Install Visual Studio 2022 Community with the workload “Desktop development with C++”.
2) In the Visual Studio Installer window, check "Desktop development with C++" under the Desktop & Mobile section. ("Game development with C++" is optional as well).
3) Click Install while downloading → Install.
4) Once the installation is finished, head to the top menu, click File → Open → Project/Solution, navigate to your project folder where you have Allegro_pacman.vcxproj, and open it.
5) Click "Local Windows Debugger" and the game will run <img width="217" height="34" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/954d5f88-0d12-4fa2-9c91-90b494dafa94" />

NOTE: Make sure to rename the file and path names if the game crashes unexpectedly upon opening.
